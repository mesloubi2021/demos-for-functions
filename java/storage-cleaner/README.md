# üöÆ Clean up files in your storage older than XX days

A sample Kotlin Cloud Function for deleting files that are older than XX days on a schedule.

## üìù Environment Variables

Go to Settings tab of your Cloud Function. Add the following environment variables.

- **APPWRITE_ENDPOINT** - Your Appwrite Endpoint
- **APPWRITE_API_KEY** - Your Appwrite API key with `files.read` and `files.write` permissions
- **DAYS_TO_EXPIRE** - Days for files to expire

## üöÄ Building and Packaging

To package this example as a cloud function, follow these steps.

* Import the project into IntelliJ, Eclipse or any other IDE that has support for Kotlin projects. 

* Build a jar for the project. Here's a [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1082580/how-to-build-jars-from-intellij-properly) to help you.

* Create a tarfile

If you followed the steps correctly, our output jar file would mostly be created at `demos-for-functions/kotlin/storage-cleaner/out/artifacts/storage_cleaner_jar/storage-cleaner.jar`

```bash
$ cd java/storage-cleaner/out/artifacts
$ tar -zcvf code.tar.gz storage_cleaner_jar
```

* Navigate to the Overview Tab of your Cloud Function > Deploy Tag
* Input the command that will run your function (in this case `java -jar storage-cleaner.jar`) as your entry point command
* Upload your `tarfile` 
* Click 'Activate'

## ‚è∞ Schedule

Head over to your function in the Appwrite console and under the Settings Tab, enter a reasonable schedule time (cron syntax).

For example:

- `*/30 * * * *` every 30 minutes
- `0 * * * *` every hour
- `0 0 * * *` every day
